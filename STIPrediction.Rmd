STI Prediction with ANN
========================================================
Intro
--------
The steps we follow will be the same as the SimpleProcedure using the sqrt. We hope to train the Neural Network according to a suitable test set in order to predict the rest of the data. Once we have trained our NN, we will do a prediction to determine the accuracy.

### Data prep 
```{r}
#Install neuralnet if not already installed
install.packages("neuralnet")
library('neuralnet')

stidata <- read.csv("STI 2004-2013_030214.csv")

# Prepare the training data
traindata <- stidata[1:50 , c("Close", "Tmr.Close")]


```
