STI Prediction with ANN
========================================================
Intro
--------
The steps we follow will be the same as the SimpleProcedure using the sqrt. We hope to train the Neural Network according to a suitable test set in order to predict the rest of the data. Once we have trained our NN, we will do a prediction to determine the accuracy.

### Data prep 
```{r}
#Install neuralnet if not already installed
install.packages("neuralnet")
library('neuralnet')

stidata <- read.csv("STI 2004-2013_030214.csv")

# Prepare the training data
# We take a set of 50 first to train the NN
traindata <- stidata[1:50 , c("Close", "Tmr.Close")]

#Close is the input and Tmr.Close is the expected output
```

### Now we train the NN 
```{r}
# Several NN needs to be generated to get a good one
stipredictor <- neuralnet(Tmr.Close ~ Close, traindata, hidden = 5, threshold = 0.01, lifesign = 'full')
print(stipredictor)
plot(stipredictor)
```

### Training complete, now we test the data
```{r}
# Create the data set from row 51 to the end
sticlose <- as.data.frame(stidata[51:2527, c("Close")])

# Compute the data
computed <- compute(stipredictor, sticlose)

print(computed$net.result)
overview <- cbind(stidata[, c("Tmr.Close")], sticlose)
```
